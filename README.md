## Projects
- **[NewsPaper Parser](https://github.com/Sanch0pansa/NewsPaperParser)** **(Parsing, NLP, Visualization, ORM)**  
  An automated system for collecting, analyzing, and visualizing news from major Russian media (RBC, TASS, KP).  
  Features scalable parsers, BERT-based text embeddings, and topic analysis with t-SNE projection.  
  Grafana for interactive dashboards. All components are containerized with Docker.
  Microservice architecture between components and multilayered design within each service.
    **Technologies: Python, PyTorch, BERT, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Grafana, Docker, SQLAlchemy, t-SNE, beautifulsoup4.**
  
- **[Video Tagger AI](https://github.com/Sanch0pansa/hackathon_video_tagging)** **(CV, NLP, Classification) - ML**  
  AI system for generating tags for RuTube videos with a working web service.  
  **Technologies: Python (BERT, VideoMAE, Vosk, MLP, SVM, Decision Tree).**

- **[ModelLang Analyzer](https://github.com/alesplll/model-lang-analyzer)** **(Parsing, Syntax, Semantics, Error Reporting)**
    A working parser for a model programming language, implementing full lexical, syntactic, and semantic analysis. The analyzer reads source code, tokenizes it, parses according to a formal grammar (recursive descent), and performs semantic checks such as variable declarations, type consistency, and logic validation. The system automatically detects both syntactic and semantic errors, returning precise diagnostics with the error type, line and column number, and a brief description (e.g., `Parsing error at line 23, column 9: Unexpected token 'counter', expected 'begin '`). Designed as a console application for educational and prototyping purposes.
    **Technologies: Python (finite automata, recursive descent parsing, symbol tables, error handling).**

- **[Messenger with AI](https://github.com/alesplll/AI_messenger)**  
  A mobile Android app with a graphical interface for chatting with ChatGPT characters.  
  Includes a server-side component handling message processing and interaction with the ChatGPT API.  
  **Technologies: Java, Python (Flask SSL, AWS, SQLite, API Integration).**

- **[Librarian](https://github.com/alesplll/Repnoe)**  
  A graphical Windows application optimizing librarian workflow.  
  Functions as a digital notebook for managing readers and borrowed books.  
  **Technologies: C#, SQLite, Windows Forms.**

- **[Text Summarizer](https://github.com/alesplll/Summarizer.git)** **(NLP, Summarization) - ML**  
  A Python-based tool for extractive and abstractive text summarization using T5-small and fine-tuned BART-large models.  
  Includes scripts for training, preprocessing, and generating summaries with an user web-interface.  
  **Technologies: Python (PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, Datasets, Scikit-learn, Streamlit).**
